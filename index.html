<p><h1>1.Your wardrobe is full of hand-me-downs</p></h1>
<center>
<p><img src="bebe3.jpg" width="300px" height="250px"></p>
</center>
<p>Unfortunately, a majority of our wardrobe is comprised of clothing pieces
passed down from our older siblings.It's very unfortunate, but teaches you how
to make the best with the least.
<p><h1>2.You know how to place blame on others</p></h1>
<center>
<p><img src="bebe5.jpg" width="300px" height="250px"></p>
</center>
<p>At the same time, we've learned how to play into the "baby" stereotype.
When we mess up or do something wrong, we know to play the innocent, "baby" card
and place the blame on the older siblings who are more likely to take the harsh
punishment.</p>
<p><h1>3.You get away with more</p></h1>
<center>
<p><img src="bebe.jpg" width="300px" height="250"></p>
</center>
<p>Let's make this clear: younger siblings know that they can get away with more,
being able to push the limits on rules that older siblings were unable to. The
reasoning for this is simple: by the time the youngest sibling comes along,
parents are less worried about raising children and because of this, are more
lenient when it comes to laying down the law.</p>
<p><h1>4.You're always referred To As "the Baby"</p></h1>
<center>
<p><img src="bebe4.jpg" width="300px" height="250px"></p>
</center>
<p>Whether you're five, 10, 21, or 64, your mother will always introduce you to
her friends as "the baby." And, unfortunately, this is usually accompanied by
the infamous cheek pinching.</p>
<p><h1>5.Your older siblings will help you out whenever you need it</p></h1>
<center>
<p><img src="bebe6.jpg" width="300px" height="250px"></p>
</center>
<p>Despite the fact that you may argue often, you know that your older siblings
are always there to offer assistance and guidance so that you don't end up
making the same mistakes they did.</p>
